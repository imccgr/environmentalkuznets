<p>
    Named after Nobel Prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets, the environmental Kuznet's Curbe relates environmental degradation (pollution) to the stage of economic development
</p>

<br>

<p>
    The increasing frequency of climate disasters across the globe calls for a coordinated response among world leaders and institutions. The Kuznets curve could help policymakers target these global efforts by reducing emissions in high-emitting countries, accelerating the path towards net zero. 
</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
    We use Particulate Matter (PM2.5) concentration data from the WHO’s API and various development indicators from the World Bank’s database to test for a relationship between development and pollution. Using both a PCA and mean-adjusted log-scaled quadratic linear regression model, we find little evidence of the relationship implied by Kuznets. Instead, plotting PM2.5 against individual indicators give very different results
</p>

<br>

<p>
    We conclude by zooming in on the Brazilian economy, which has experienced substantial economic development over the last 30 years and has seen a decline in its air pollution level since 2010.
</p>

<br>

<h3> Our initial aims and motivation </h3>

<br>

<p>
    We started working on initial ideas around the time of the COP27, so we wanted to look into the theme of climate data. We were inspired by the works of UChicago’s Esteban Rossi-Hansberg in the field of quantitative spatial economics, notably his works using satellite data. We initially wanted to focus on an economic region, such as Sub-Saharian Africa, and look at intertemporal changes in development and air pollution. For example, comparing economies such as Nigeria and Mali and their levels of air pollution over time could tell us about the shape of the Philips curve during the industrialisation stage. Comparing these levels to average pollution levels (over the last two decades) in developed (post-industrialised) economies in Europe would give a broad indication of the shape of the Philips curve. However, because of constraints on data (particularly in developing economies in Sub Saharian Africa), we opted to look at fixed time pollution data but with a larger sample of countries. As such, gathering pollution data for a given year by country and would enable us to show all stages of development and obtain a worldwide Environmental Kuznets curve. 
</p>

<br>
<p>Furthermore, a goal of COP27 is to help industrialising economies navigate a lower emission path without sacrificing economic development. Looking at a large sample of countries would reveal outliers in the trend, and would pin down which countries need to do the most efforts to combat their pollution level given their level of development. This exercise could prove quite useful for global policymakers as we aim for net zero without sacrificing economic growth. 
</p>

<br>

<h3>Our central hypothesis is that PM2.5 concentration levels peak during the industrialisation stage of development. </h3>

<br>

<p>
    In the economics literature, there is a recent focus on the relationship between economic development and the environment, with the debate centering between optimists and pessimists. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory, first introduced by Grossman and Krueger (1991),  suggests that there is a U shaped relationship between environmental degradation and income, namely that the level of environmental degradation will increase until a certain level of income is reached, and after this point the environment will improve. The EKC has been tested empirically in a number of studies, but the results have mixed. 
    other studies, considered relationships between other indicators such as arsenic/lead/mercury concentration, NOx, SO2, CO emissions.

    <h2>Our Main Aim</h2>
    <p>The primary aim of our project is to recreate a Kuznets curve by using development data and PM2.5 concentration data for all countries for a fixed time period. Our final curve will have a combined development index on the x-axis and PM2.5 concentration on the y-axis (averaged over one decade).</p>
    <p>Our datapoints will be individual countries’ level of development and level of air pollution for a fixed time period. We will be able to encapsulate all stages of development, which will enable us to have a full Kuznets curve. If our hypothesis is correct, we will expect the graph to have a bell shape. The secondary aim of our research is to investigate the strength of individual development indicators in predicting the level of air pollution, and use World Bank data to generate plots for PM2.5 concentration against individual indicators</p>
    <p>Finally, we will look at time series data of PM2.5 concentration indicators and create animated plots on R, showing selected countries' pollution paths at key development stages. We will also focus on a single country-Brazil, and see if we see evidence of the EKC relation when doing city comparisons. </p>

<br> 


<p>As mentioned above, our research uses PM.5 data as a proxy for environmental degradation. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter, defined as particles that are less than 2.5. microns or less in diameter. PM2.5 is an air pollutant that is a concern for people’s health at a high level. Pm2.5 particles can be inhaled, depositing on airways and lungs, causing tissue damage and lung inflammation. They can cause an array of health issues including  premature mortality, increased hospital admissions for heart or lung causes, acute and chronic bronchitis. </p>

        <p>To measure economic development, we require various development indicators. In order to make our data easier to analyse, our development indicator data comes from a single year (2018), which has the least missing data across the indicators we have selected. We select 10 development indicators from the Health, Nutrition and Population statistics, which are shown below:</p>
