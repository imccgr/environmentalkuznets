# Environmental Kuznets Curve Analysis

## Overview of project

This project evaluates the validity of the Environmental Kuznets curve: a theory that postulates an inverted-U relationship between the level of economic development and environmental degradation.

We use evidence from PM2.5 and economic indicators data worldwide, finally focusing on Brazil, a country that went through substantial economic development in the last 30 years.
